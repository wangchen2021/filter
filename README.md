# Software for automating the design of planar filters for use in next generation wireless systems.

Develop code for the design of 2 popular forms of low-pass microwave filter
e.g.: 1) stub filter, 2) stepped-impedance filter. Validate the designs obtained by
building models of the filters in Microwave Office or CST Microwave Studio.


Develop code for the design of at least 1 popular form of band-pass microwave
filter e.g.: parallel coupled line filter. Validate the designs obtained by building
models of the filters in Microwave Office or CST Microwave Studio.
